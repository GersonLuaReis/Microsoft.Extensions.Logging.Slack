# Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Slack

This project is not a part of ASP.NET Core, but a provider for `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` who will log into [Slack](https://slack.com/).

More info are available here http://tostring.it/2015/11/23/Log-your-application-errors-into-Slack/

The package is almost done, but not release yet (need to write the unit tests), soon on nuget.
